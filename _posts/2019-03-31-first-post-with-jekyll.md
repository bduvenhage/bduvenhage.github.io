Jekyll pretty is cool.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight c++ %}
#include <iostream>
  
int main(void)
{
  std::cout << "Hi, Tom.\n";
  return 0;
}
// prints "Hi, Tom." to stdout.
{% endhighlight %}
