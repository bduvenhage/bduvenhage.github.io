Jekyll is pretty cool. I followed their [Quickstart](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) guide which generates a basic blog site using the minima theme. Once you push the site to your `https://github.com/<username>/<username>.github.io` repo Github Pages will build your Jekyll site and make it available online at `<username>.github.io`.

To add a new post, one simply pushes a markdown formatted post to the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.md` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea of what the front matter looks like.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight c++ %}
#include <iostream>
  
int main(void)
{
  std::cout << "Hi, Tom.\n";
  return 0;
}
// prints "Hi, Tom." to stdout.
{% endhighlight %}

Inline tables are done like so:

| Priority apples | Second priority | Third priority |
|-------|--------|---------|
| ambrosia | gala | red delicious |
| pink lady | jazz | macintosh |
| honeycrisp | granny smith | fuji |

Inline figures are done like so:

- ![Logo Jekyll]({{site.url}}/assets/images/jekyll-logo.png )

- ![Logo Jekyll]({{"/assets/images/jekyll-logo.png" | absolute_url}})

 - ![Logo Jekyll](http://memofil.github.io/assets/images/categories/jekyll-logo.png =100x20)

- ![Logo Jekyll](/jekyll-logo.png)
