Jekyll is pretty cool. I followed their [Quickstart](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) guide which generates a basic blog site using the minima theme. Once you push the site to your `https://github.com/<username>/<username>.github.io` repo Github Pages will build your Jekyll site and make it available online at `<username>.github.io`.

To add a new post, one simply adds a markdown formatted post in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.md` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea of what the front matter looks like.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight c++ %}
#include <iostream>
  
int main(void)
{
  std::cout << "Hi, Tom.\n";
  return 0;
}
// prints "Hi, Tom." to stdout.
{% endhighlight %}
